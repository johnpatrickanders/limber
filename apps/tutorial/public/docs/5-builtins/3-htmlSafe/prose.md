Glimmer, by default, protects you against [Cross-Site-Scripting][xss] attacks, where an attack may try to get malicious code rendered on a page to scrape or send information from other user sessions.

The `htmlSafe` utility is used when you have input that you either _know_ to be safe or are reasonably certain that rendering the input will have no negative consequence (for example, maybe untrusted input is run through a sanitizer (such as [PurifyDOM](https://github.com/cure53/DOMPurify)).

```hbs
{{htmlSafe untrusted}}
```
